看了卢昌海的《上下百亿年：太阳的故事》系列，心中的「小男孩」又开始骚动了，想起了《好奇年代》（The Age of Wonder）里面引用的赫歇尔（Sir John Herschel）的一句话：He walks  in the midst of wonders。浪漫至极。全文如下，权当鸡血吧。

> Accustomed to trace the operations of general causes and the exemplification of general laws, in circumstances where the uninformed and uninquiring eye, perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he walks in the midst of wonders; every object which falls in his way elucidates some principle, affords some instruction and impresses him with a sense of harmony and order. Nor is it a mere passive pleasure which is thus communicated. A thousand questions are continually arising in his mind, a thousand objects of enquiry presenting themselves, which keep his faculties in constant exercise, and his thoughts perpetually on the wing, so that lassitude is excluded from his life, and that craving after artificial excitement and dissipation of the mind, which leads so many into frivolous, unworthy, and destructive pursuits, is altogether eradicated from his bosom.
